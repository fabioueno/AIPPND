# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

This repository contains code and associated files for the [AI Programming with Python
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) program, from Udacity.

## Core Curriculum

The core curriculum, as the name suggests, contains the core topics for this Nanodegree program. For the majority of
them I took notes in Jupyter Notebooks, but there are exceptions, which I didn't find necessary, such as `Introduction
to Python`.

### 01. Introduction to AI Programming

The first part of the core curriculum of this Nanodegree is just an introduction to the course and the platform
including the instructors presentations and proposed lesson plan.

### 02. Introduction to Python

This section explains the Python basics: data types and operators, data structures, control flow with conditional
statements, loops, functions and scopes, lambda expressions, iterators and generators, scripting and object-oriented
programming.

### 03. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

In the third module, we're taught about [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), a
package and environment manager build specifically for data and a form of literate programming, respectively. Both wide
addopted in the data science community.

We also use [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) &
[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) to manipulate arrays effectively, handle tabular data and visualize data in
multiple ways.

Jupyter Notebooks:
 - [NumPy](../01-numpy.ipynb)
 - [Pandas](../02-pandas.ipynb)
 - [Matplotlib & Seaborn](../04-matplotlib-seaborn.ipynb)

### 04. Linear Algebra Essentials

After studying the libraries that'll assist us in building our models, we saw linear algebra, learning about vectors
and matrices, linear combination and linear transformation. We finished this chapter looking how neural networks are
related to linear algebra.

Jupyter Notebooks:
- [Linear Algebra](../05-linear-algebra.ipynb)

### 05. Calculus Essentials

The last topic before deep diving into neural networks is Calculus and how it is used in Neural Networks.

### 06. Neural Networks

Finally, before the final project, we were introduced to core topics involving deep learning and neural networks, such
as gradient descent, feedforward and backpropagation. Then, we trained and tested our networks using
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
